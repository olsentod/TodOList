# TodOList

## About
This is a simple todo list app make entirely with vanilla JS. It uses the ES6 classes and singleton design pattern.
Todos are saved to local storage on your machine so if you save any todos you will see them when you come back.
It is capable of being built in an Electron App and I've used that to keep track of things.

## Run
Just load up the index.html file in a browser and it will work!
